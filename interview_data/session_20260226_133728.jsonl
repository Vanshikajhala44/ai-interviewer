However, there seems to be a bit of confusion in your explanation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n* **Supervised Learning**: This type of learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct output is already known. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and the corresponding output labels.\n* **Unsupervised Learning**: In this type of learning, the model is trained", "timestamp": "2026-02-26T13:39:59.028390"}
