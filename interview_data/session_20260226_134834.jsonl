I'm excited to learn more about your skills and experience in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Throughout this interview, I'll be asking you a series of technical questions to assess your knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\n\nLet's get started with the first question:\n\n1. What is the difference between training and inference in AI models?\n\nPlease go ahead and share your thoughts on this topic.

Training is indeed a crucial part of the AI model development process. To expand on your answer, training in AI refers to the process of feeding a model with a large dataset, allowing it to learn patterns, relationships, and representations of the data. The goal of training is to optimize the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.\n\nInference, on the other hand, is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or take actions on new, unseen data.
