It's great to hear that you're pursuing your BTech and working on a project that involves AI and Django. That's a fascinating combination.\n\nSo, it sounds like you have some experience with Python, Django, and AI. That's a great foundation for a career in software development.\n\nBefore we dive into the technical questions, I just want to clarify a few things. Since you're working on a project that involves AI and Django, I'll try to ask questions that are relevant to those areas. However, I may also ask some general Python", "timestamp": "2026-02-24T23:40:57.488212"}

Can you explain the difference between static typing and dynamic typing in programming languages? How does Python fit into this classification, and what are some implications of Python being a dynamically-typed language?\n\n(And don't worry, I'll try to ask a mix of easy and challenging questions to assess your knowledge and problem-solving skills.)\n\nAlso, just to confirm, by AIML, you mean Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, right?", "timestamp": "2026-02-24T23:42:21.670663"}
